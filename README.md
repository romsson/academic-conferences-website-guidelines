# Guidelines for Academic Conference Websites

*A set of best practices for building simple and just-enough websites to host details of an academic conference. Keep in mind nobody has time--both organizers and participants. This is a solved problem so we don't need to reinvent the wheel.*

tl;dr Keep it simple. Be lazy and cheap.

Rules:

* Single-page
* Text-only
* Responsive

Structure (order matters):

* Title, type of the conference (e.g. workshop, summer school) and if joint with another event
* Topics overview, expected outputs
* Important dates
* Organizers and contact informations
* Submission format
* More details (topics, context, ..)

You might want to add the following sections once the program of the conference is known. You might want to re-order the above structure accordingly:

* Program
* Venue information
* Registration fees

After the conference:

* Upate with presentations / papers (if publicly available)
* Change text to the past
* Link to the following edition of the events

Misc notes:

* Do not register a domain name for this conference / event. There is 99% chances it won't be renewed and will end up in domain parking.

Examples

* Use [this webpage](http://vizsec.org/#venue) as a template. This has all the ingredients of a perfect conference website. Every single bit of it.
